# SubsetGenerator
A Rust library to generate and iterate over the subsets of a dataset.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
subset-generator = "0.1.0"
```

## Examples
We have two examples, one for the [Subset Sum problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem) and one for the [Set Cover problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_cover_problem), in particular, we solve the optimization variant for the Set Cover problem. See [here](https://github.com/satanja/subset_generator/tree/main/examples) for the examples.
